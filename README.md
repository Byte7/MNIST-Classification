# MNIST-Classification
MNIST classification using scikit-learn  
Classifiers used are - 
1. SGDClassifier(for binary classification) - 98% accuracy
2. RandomForestClassifier - 95% accuracy
3. KNeighborsClassifier - 97% accuracy

### Improvements
1. Over 97% accuracy can be achieved using KNeighborsClassifier with good hyperparameters values(grid search on weights and n_neighbors hyperparameters)(takes long time)  
2. CNN can be used to get over 99%
